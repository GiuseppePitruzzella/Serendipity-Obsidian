![Release Badge](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/lazercaveman/firefly-obsidian-theme)

Firefly Theme is a dark theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) in the making. The template a provides clean UI and decent color accents.

I took inspiration from some other themes (see credits), with the goal of creating an Obsidian theme that has more of the look and feel of a code editor in editor mode, and relies on more extended text formatting in preview mode, to deliver more of a blog ux. 

## 📥  How-To Install the Firefly Theme into Obsidian

### Through Obsidian Marketplace (Recommended)
1. Open the Settings in Obsidian
2. Navigate to Appearances tab under Options
3. Under the Themes section, click on the Browse button next to Community Themes
4. Search for Night Owl in the Filter text input in the upper left corner
5. Click Use and then you're done! 🎉

### Manually
1. Download `obsidian.css`from the this repo.
1. Rename the file to `Firefly.css`, to make sure that it has a unique name (preventing duplicates).
2. Place the file into your vault's /.obsidian/themes directory.
3. Open the Settings in Obsidian.
4. Navigate to Appearances tab under Options, also Ensure that the 'Base mode' setting is set to `Dark mode` and that 'Custom CSS' is turned on.
5. Under the Themes section, click on the dropdown menu next to Theme heading.
6. Select for Firefly and then you're done! 🎉

## 📓 Fonts
This theme uses the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and [JetBrains Mono](https://jetbrains.com/mono) fonts. For the best experience, I recommend installing these fonts onto your local machine.
