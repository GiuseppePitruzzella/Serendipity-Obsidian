# Firefly Obsidian Theme
Firefly Theme is a dark theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Which provides clean UI and decent color accents.

Within the editor view, the font size of text elements is equal to another (accept H1) - to provide a more code editor look and feel. Colors in editor and preview are always the same, even when preview mode adds some styling to texts.
This theme uses the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and [JetBrains Mono](https://jetbrains.com/mono) fonts. For the best experience, I recommend installing these fonts onto your local machine.

## How-To implement the Theme into Obsidian
1. Download `Firefly.css`from the this repo.
2. Place this in the root of your Obsidian notes directory.
3. Open the Settings in Obsidian
4. Navigate to Appearances tab under Options, also Ensure that the 'Base mode' setting is set to `Dark mode` and that 'Custom CSS' is turned on.
5. Under the Themes section, click on the dropdown menu next to Theme heading
6. Select for Firefly and then you're done! üéâ
